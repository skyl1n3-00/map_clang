# Map Data Structure in C Language
___

This project is Map Data Structure implementation in C language.

**Map Data Structure**  
A Map it's a data structure which stores data as a Key & Value pair, where the first part of the data structure also is another data structure (Set) which represents a set of elements that are unique.

**The project contains four types of Map**
1. Map Int Int (int as key and int as value) all functions are implemented in ``` map_ii_functions.h ```
2. Map String String (string as key and string as value) all functions are implemented in ``` map_ss_functions.h ```
3. Map Int String (int as key and string as value) all functions are implemented in ``` map_is_functions.h ```
4. Map String Int (string as key and int as value) all functions are implemented in ``` map_si_functions.h ```

> DM me (email in Git logs) if an other type is needed.
